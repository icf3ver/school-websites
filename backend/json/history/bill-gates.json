        {"type": "text", "text": "Bill Gates is no longer the “CEO” of Microsoft, having handed off the reigns of the company to Steve Ballmer in 2000, who then handed them off to Satia Nadella in 2014. However, he remains the owner of the corporation and still is deeply involved in some operations of the company. Being the cofounder of the company and having managed the company for nearly 25 years, he was the CEO for much of the events described in this article."},

        {"type": "text", "text": "A company that started in a garage in the 70’s and became one of the most successful tech companies in the world, the legendary rise of Microsoft is much spoken about in our society today. At first Bill Gates and his team focused on the development of user friendly, powerful interpreters and microprocessors for an early personal computer known as the Altair 8800. When IBM adopted its operating system MS-DOS, Microsoft then rose to dominate the operating systems market, a market that had only just been created. This monopoly on such a new, attractive and essential market allowed Microsoft to mature at such an extraordinary rate."},

        {"type": "text", "text": "But how is it possible for a tech company in today's industry to pull off such a feat? The answer to this question is not as clear cut as the question makes it appear to be. In a market dominated by huge names such as that of Apple, IBM, and indeed, Microsoft, such a feat would be nothing short of a miracle. The main issue is not, contrary to popular belief, competition. In fact, as is the case with Microsoft and Apple, competition often leads to rapid growth and development. The main issue arises when large firms such as IBM or Microsoft decide that it would be profitable to buy out the competition or to integrate vertically to take over the market and gain a monopoly."},
        {"type": "text", "text": "But it's not all bad. Having a powerhouse such as Microsoft in an economy has its benefits. Microsoft can provide funding and can collaborate with smaller businesses. This can help small businesses develop. Another advantage of having a large corporation such as Microsoft is it provides a reliable source of stable jobs in an economy."},

        {"type": "text", "text": "The answer to this question is again not as clear cut as it might seem. While Bill Gates' team started out by selling interpreters, the company quickly expanded its scope. The innovation that really gave Microsoft the kickstart it needed to take over and revolutionize an industry was its first operating system. MS-DOS or Microsoft’s Disk Operating System allowed Microsoft to vertically integrate with suppliers and start offering a broader range of products and services. Similarly, during the Gilded Age, many companies used the model of vertical integration to create a monopoly. For example, steel mill companies would buy their suppliers, thus ensuring that these would not be able to supply competitors of the mill. In Microsoft's case, by controlling operating systems, the company was able in a sense to control the entirety of every supply chain that had anything to do with computing. "},

        {"type": "text", "text": "Certainly Microsoft could not be blamed to seek a monopoly. It had no competition yet because competition had not had time to meet the standards Microsoft had put up for operating systems. Microsoft was not only holding a monopoly, the company was the driver of a technological revolution as a whole. Even today, with competitors like Apple and Linux having gained a significant market share, Microsoft is still a captain of industry in that it was and remains the backbone of a technological revolution."},
        {"type": "text", "text": "CEO's like James Hill, who owned the Great Northern Railways or Andrew Carnegie, who owned one of largest steel production companies in the US, also were considered robber barons, which means American industrialists who became wealthy by exploiting people and using despicable business practices. Like Bill Gates, they pursued vertical integration to expand their empires. However, I believe that CEO’s like Henry Ford or Bill Gates should be considered captains of industry due not only to their impassioned drive to revolutionize technology and make it available to all, but also their success in the nurturing of revolutions that changed the industry as a whole.

        {"type": "text", "text": "Similarly to the corporations of the Gilded Age, Microsoft’s innovations changed how we live and how our society is structured. A key difference between the formation of the corporations that reigned free in the Gilded Age and the formation of Microsoft can be clearly seen in how the employees are treated by companies. During the Gilded Age, workers were subjected to harsh working environments and worked for very low salaries while the CEOs became extremely wealthy and didn’t care about worker’s well-being. Company owners tried to suppress unions and revolts from the employees. The Gilded Age led to a time where company owners had high authority over their employees and employees had little protection from their employer’s abuses."},

And while a hierarchy had to emerge as the company grew and focus changed, the original goal remained part of the company’s culture."},
